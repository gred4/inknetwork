Alexander Bard,"Cyber-Philospher, Music Producer, Television star","Alexander Bard is a Swedish cyber-philosopher, music producer, television star, and sought- after international speaker. He has given lectures on the philosophical, sociological, and economic implications of the digital revolution since the late 1990s, and been a fundamental force in creating the Swedish music export sensation. As a social entrepreneur, Bard is deeply involved in a series a highly successful technology companies as well as spiritual and political projects.   Bard studied Economic Geography at The Stockholm School of Economics in the 1980s while building a highly successful international career as a songwriter and record producer. In 1992 he co-founded Stockholm Records, which quickly achieved global success – with bands like The Cardigans, A-Teens, and Bard’s own Army of Lovers – and in 1998 was sold to and integrated with Universal Music. Even as he was occupied with cyber-philosophy and political activism to find the time for any more song-writing, Bard hit No. 1 on records in Europe, Asia, and North America as recently as 2013. He is, perhaps unsurprisingly, also a television celebrity in Scandinavia, as the tough judge on the talent shows Swedish Idol and Sweden’s Got Talent.   Bard has written five books together with media theorist Jan Söderqvist. The first three titles – The Netocrats, The Global Empire and The Body Machines – have been released together as The Futurica Trilogy and translated into over 20 languages. A fourth book, Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age, released in 2014 and a fifth title, Digital Libido – Sex, Power and Violence in The Network Society, released in 2018. In all the books, Bard & Söderqvist construct a brand new metaphysical system for the digital age, covering everything from the inner existential truths of the new physics to the radical utopian potential of participatory culture."
